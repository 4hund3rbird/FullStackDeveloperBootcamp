        <p>
            Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June
            1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue
            1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in
            the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven
            Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or
            Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona,
            where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four
            UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most
            goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and
            the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa
            América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (86). Messi
            has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a
            single club.

        <h2>Club Career</h2>
        </p>

        <p>Barcelona
            2003–2005: Rise to the first team
            "It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life."

            – Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[32]
            During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks,
            debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[33] After being named player of the tournament
            in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with
            the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[34][35]
            Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the
            international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training
            session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place
            to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players
            and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[36]

            At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th
            minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[24][37] His performance,
            creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training
            daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[38] After his first
            training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he
            believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[39] Ronaldinho soon befriended
            Messi, whom he called "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[40][41]

        <p>According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between
            2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in
            2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[166][535] Messi was second on
            Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from
            his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[536] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark
            for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and
            endorsements.[537] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[538] From 2008, he was
            Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13
            million over the next five years.[82][83][147] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000
            per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus.[539] His buyout clause
            was set at $835 million (€700 million).[539] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer (and second athlete
            in a team sport), after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[540]

            In addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has
            consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began
            in 2010.[541] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth
            prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully
            challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[542] Over time, Messi established himself as
            their leading brand endorser;[534] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50
            boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas
            Messi.[543][544] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[545] In 2015, a Barcelona
            jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[546]</p>
