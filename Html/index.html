    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <p>The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and
        general relativity, proposed and published in 1905 and 1915, respectively.[1] Special relativity applies to all
        physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its
        relation to other forces of nature.[2] It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including
        astronomy.[3]
        The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old
        theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton.[3][4][5] It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional
        spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time
        dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary
        particles and their
        fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics
        predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational
        waves.[3][4][5]

    <h2>Special Relativity:</h2>

    <p>
        Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "On the
        Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" (for the contributions of many other physicists see History of special
        relativity). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in classical mechanics:

        The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference relative to one another
        (principle of relativity).
        The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the
        motion of the light source.
        The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains
        the results of the MichelsonMorley experiment. Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive
        consequences. Some of these are:

        Relativity of simultaneity: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another
        observer if the observers are in relative motion.
        Time dilation: Moving clocks are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's "stationary" clock.
        Length contraction: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to
        the observer.
        Maximum speed is finite: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in
        a vacuum.
        The effect of gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.
        Mass energy equivalence: E = mc2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.
        Relativistic mass, idea used by some researchers.[9]
        The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean transformations of classical
        mechanics by the Lorentz transformations. (See Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.)

    <h2>General Relativity:</h2>

    <p>
        General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 19071915. The development of
        general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being
        at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically
        identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because
        that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of
        gravity as is the case in classical mechanics. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special
        relativity because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but
        objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. In
        1915, he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and
        any momentum within it.

        Some of the consequences of general relativity are:

        Gravitational time dilation: Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells.[10]
        Precession: Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton's theory of gravity. (This has been observed in the
        orbit of Mercury and in binary pulsars).
        Light deflection: Rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field.
        Frame-dragging: Rotating masses "drag along" the spacetime around them.
        Metric expansion of space: The universe is expanding, and the far parts of it are moving away from us faster
        than the speed of light.
        Technically, general relativity is a theory of gravitation whose defining feature is its use of the Einstein
        field equations. The solutions of the field equations are metric tensors which define the topology of the
        spacetime and how objects move inertially.

        Experimental evidence
        Einstein stated that the theory of relativity belongs to a class of "principle-theories". As such, it employs an
        analytic method, which means that the elements of this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical
        discovery. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical
        models to describe what we observed, and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be
        satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions.[2]
